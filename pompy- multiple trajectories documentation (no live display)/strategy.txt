
To do: Test every different movement mode (not every combination!) Done.

Naviagation:
1. Go upwind. Tested.
2.Traverse at alpha angle to wind direction 
If alpha == 0, it is excatly the same as mode 1
Note that the moth cannot turn while in this navigation mode. Tested.

Casting:
1.stop completely.Tested.
2.traverse at alpha angle. Start timer at the start of every turn and turn when it ends.
Duration grows in a factor of 1.6 every time the moth turns. Tested.
3.the same as cast_type 2 with the addition of a modification of duration and alpha according to odor levels. Note that there is only one alpha per moth. that may be changed in the future. Tested.
4.90 degree angles using a timer. duration grows at every turn. Tested.

Waiting:
1. stopping completely (ground speed = 0) Tested.
2.randomly choosing between left and right and proceeding in that direction. Tested (but would need to make the enviorment semi infinite for it to work properly.) 


Best combination in terms of accuracy so far is nav_type 1, Cast type_3, wait type_1



Tasks for next week -
1. update_alpha and update_duration have not yet been fine-tuned
2. There is no proper "Operations research" for different moths - I should put in a function that saves the movement of the moth as a list of (x,y) tuples 
3. Another function that presents the list created in #2 on a matrix using imshow.
4. Finish reading the article and implement new movement types.
5. to realize (even theoretically) how implement a timer on the "is_smelling" function
that makes the moth act as if it is still smelling for certein time even out of the plume.
